# Network Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning

This project detects anomalies in network traffic using a Random Forest classifier.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib

2. Run the script:
   python network_anomaly_detection.py

## Output

- Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report will be printed.
- The trained model is saved as `anomaly_detector.pkl`.
